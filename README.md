### Hi there 👋! I'm Darrick!

I'm a full stack enginner specializing in React/ Redux, Javascript and Rails

One of the projects I'm most proud of was [PantryChef](https://pantry-chef-mern.herokuapp.com/. In the span of four days, I, along with a couple friends, were able to make a fully fledged recipe search website that shows you what you can make now, with the ingredients in your pantry.

Another project that I'm super excited about is [Kelp](https://kelp-yelp-clone.herokuapp.com/). It's a seafood based clone of yelp, complete with User Auth, Review Crud, and Google Maps API integration. It took me a little over a week to implement this with rails backend and react/redux frontend.

I'm currently working on brushing up on DS&A and working on a couple side projects, but on my off time, you can find me taking care of my chickens 🐔, gardening 🧑‍🌾, or fishing 🎣!

You can reach me at darrickshin@gmail.com, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrick-shin/), or [AngelList](https://angel.co/u/darrick-shin) if you'd like to reach out or collab!

I'm currently open to Full Stack, Backend, or Frontend Engineering jobs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Portland, or remote!
